# FLAMES and Zodiac Signs Compatibility Calculator
<h3>FLAMES &amp; Zodiac Sign Compatibility using HTML, CSS &amp; PHP. </h3>

<p>This was a laboratory activity. 

This is an integration of HTML, CSS and PHP website that provides a demonstration of simple PHP functions and object-oriented design. 
The activity provides FLAMES and ZODIAC SIGN compatibility. Resources (backgrounds and images) are from Canva, and made to integrate for visual purposes. 

In this website/program, the user will be required to fill the necessary fields: FIRST NAME, LAST NAME, and BIRTHDATE. The corresponding information will be asked twice, as it is one for the user himself, and for his/her crush. Once the inputs are processed, the program will display their names in last name, first name format, 
their zodiac signs, FLAMES compatibility and zodiac sign compatibility.</p>

<b>What is FLAMES?</b> <br>
<p>The user's name will be compared to other's name - it will further be assessed, similar letters will be extracted. This technique will be applied as well when 
the other's name will be compared to the user's name. In line with this, after extracting the similar letters from both names, it will be added altogether and 
be solved with modulo 6. The resulting number will correspond to a letter in FLAMES.</br>
F (Friends) = 1, L (Lovers) = 2, A (Angry) = 3, M (Married) = 4, E (Engaged) = 5 and S (Soulmates) = 0</p>

<b>What are ZODIAC SIGNS?</b> <br>
<p>Zodiac signs are composed of 12 zodiac signs that are usually meant for birthdates. These are the following; Aries, Leo, Sagittarius, Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn, 
Gemini, Libra, Aquarius, Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces. These are assessed using a multi-dimensional array in the program. </br>
